Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins are both so good. She makes a great heroine. Thought it was clever the way the camera was always focussed on people's eyes whether it was his creepy eyes or men ogling her or her looking all tough. All round top stuff.

Covers a lot of ground - money/careers/relationships/mortality in a subtle way and has a great cast. Ended a little too quickly but better than it going on too long. Ty Burrell and Simon McBurney's relationship was really funny too. I think everyone could find a character (or two) that they relate to which was good. I think I related to Jennifer Aniston haha.

Superheroes are ultimately silly and I feel like Spiderman films are usually aware of that. Lots of plotholes because it's multiverse stuff but that didn't matter too much (why doesn't Dr S just fix everything/Tom Holland is at fault for all this dumb stuff when he could have just reapplied for uni or whatever/why were there not more spidermen from other universes?). They did the bit with the other spidermen really well I thought - Tobey Maguire was funny & good. Don't get why marvel films are all lit so weirdly though, at nearly no point do any of the characters look like they're where they're supposed to be."

Entertaining and I enjoyed the script but it didn't have the same style as Snatch for example. It never really felt like it was really the criminal underworld you know? Still worth a watch though.

Both the leads are great, mad that they've never acted before because they have a lot to do here. Bradley Cooper is the best of some pretty good side characters. Lot's of running scenes, maybe the motorbike one being the best. Looking forward to seeing it again. "

I liked the ambiguity of it, never signalling to the audience what they should think about any of it. Quite sad in some ways but plenty of humour in it too.

A simpler story than some but very sweet without quite as much style as The French Dispatch (but he really loves yellow). Similar themes to Licorice Pizza in a way - young love and naivety. I think his quirkiness really suits a scout camp - in my experience the film is full of the sort of weird dramas that fill a week away from your parents at that age and make it feel like an incredibly significant week, until the next one. Bruce Willis is good too, he should do more stuff like this."
tt2106476,The Hunt,2012,Thomas Vinterberg,['Drama'],8.3,92,115,"A teacher lives a lonely life, all the while struggling over his son's custody.

The premise is great but the script really makes it something better - every point in the story makes you wince and it really feels like it could all happen and there's nothing you could do about it. Great ambiguous ending too - at first I thought perhaps he had imagined it and he was having flashbacks to being hunted again, but it could also be Karla's older brother shooting at him I suppose. Mads obviously great."
tt1116184,Jackass 3D,2010,Jeff Tremaine,"['Documentary', 'Action', 'Comedy']",7,66,94,"Johnny Knoxville and company return for the third installment of their TV show spin-off, where dangerous stunts and explicit public displays rule.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NTQ1NTE4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzEzMzA3NA@@._V1_SX300.jpg,English,R,13/1/2022,Y,7,Netflix,"Not as funny as the first one to be honest although there are some of the grossest pranks they do - the sweatsuit cocktail is disgusting and so is the poo volcano thing. Grim haha. Still good though, laughter is contagious."

The main guy was very convincingly grumpy and it was all done very well and the flashback structure worked well. Did make me cry a little bit when he starts to enjoy his life after Sonja. Her makeup on the train at the end was a bit weird though for some reason haha."

Pretty devoid of any romantic central relationship either which didn't help all that much. Also personally I rarely like stuff when they talk at the camera. The music was good but I couldn't understand all the references (although that isn't really a criticism)."

Every shot was crafted so carefully and it's all so warm and colourful. Also brillianty edited - there's so many short shots that end up really making the film but must have taken a very clever person to pull off. It shows the passing of time very effectively as well as the brutality of that. Very similar themes to Chungking Express - longing, loneliness, memory, missed opportunities. Would very much like to see it again. Also the 4K looked really great. Cinema I suppose."

I didn't think a whole lot of (most of) the music but Rasputin was good and pretty scary plus the story was alright. Animation was cool including some weird attempts at 3D tech which must have just been invented or something.

Looks amazing throughout with some really cool shots (Flying one, shot alongside the cars when they're trying to steal one, massive dolly zoom, when they're peeing in the bathroom and with the mirror). Mad ending as well, was good to watch with an audience because it's quite sudden and then silence and you could feel the quiet in the cinema."

The scenes reversing the truck, in the casting room, on the golf course and on the waterbed with the light shining from underneath are all so great. It also remains mad that both the stars are first time actors - Cooper Hoffman is amazing at running, and Alana Haim is very good with her face (and has a good face)"

But the whole thing did have a very early 2000s TV movie vibe which it could never quite shake. Good soundtrack and clever animation although maybe overused. Strangely enough the director (married to the main guy) was diagnosed with cancer in post production.

Final fight scene in the loader suit is great, and the xenomorphs all look gross and terrifying. Lighting and set design are both amazing too.  Less character development than the first one but Ripley is great at least. The last hour or so is is especially intense."

Seemed like a documentary/feature but I guess it was actually a mockumentary in a way. Sean Penn is great playing a role I've not really seen him in before, he manages to come off as both extremely self confident and uncomfortably insecure at the same time. Music was nice too. I liked the running Django Reinhardt character."

Funny as ever, definitely better than the second one and was helpful to have some fresh blood. Zach Holmes was especially good. Johnny Knoxville is so good at being the ringleader. Could barely watch the cup test once they got to the pogo stick and the bear one was mental."

They really all felt like real characters to me - every one had some complexity. Also it was properly funny, particularly in the first half. The main actress was really great too, she had to have a lot of range. Break up scene felt very real and I liked the pause scene before it, felt like we were in her head weighing up the decision she was about to make. Oslo looked amazing too."

On paper it could seem boring but it was such a great film, really has it all - lots of funny scenes, wisdom and beautiful shots. Every scene is rich with something and it winds up beinga  great portrait of life in general and captures that feeling that there are different perspectives to everything. Some standout scenes: when NJ and his daughter are both simultaneousely on dates and he talks about his first date as his daughter's first date is mirroring it exactly. The wedding scene at the beginning, Yang Yang in the photo shop, Yang Yang giving his photos to his uncle/dad and explaining how he was helping them to get perspective, the funeral speech at the end, Ota's magic trick. Some all time great characters too in Yang Yang and Ota. Left me feeling like I wanted to burst in to tears at the end."

""People aren't just one thing"" was a good bit. Somehow I think it just lost the point it was making towards the end but I'm intrigued to see what Joe Talbot does next - was pretty great for a first feature film. Jonathan Majors is great too."

The camerawork was great I think that really contributed to the effect of feeling like you're not sure whether she is imagining it or not. The way the camera was sometimes peeking around corners or having these wide-ish shots were very effective in giving the impression that there might be someone we couldn't see stood right there. Elisabeth Moss was really good too and I actually thought it was quite a good allegory -  I suppose it was making a point about not believing victims of abuse? which it did well. "

His motives seemed a bit clearer and he seemed more of a person than a billionaire dude like in the previous ones. Fight scenes weren't all that great but I liked that it was more focussed on Batman the detective working with Commissioner Gordon. The Riddler was mostly good except for that Ave Maria bit which I didn't get/seemed liked it was trying too hard to make him seem unhinged (he already seemed unhinged, he just flooded the whole city). Gotham was good and dark and Colin Farrel was unrecognisable. Zoe Kravitz is a good catwoman too and their relationship was more interesting/important than usual. Didn't always flow that well I didn't think but the story was good and I liked it mostly."

A lot of the climbing is skimmed over and I didn't think it documented the challenges they faced all that well. Most of the climbs were a few shots and then him at the summit celebrating. K2 was the best bit but even then after he comes up with a plan to set the fixed lines at 1am and says ""Camp 2 today, Camp 4 tomorrow then summit day after"" and starts walking, they only then showed a few shots of him near the top rather than him executing his plan.

Russell Crowe was really good I thought. The plot was a little bit thin but it looked great and must have been amazing to film.

Nice style of animation similar to the bao short. Very good at showing that period of time when you start to move away from your parents in certain aspects of your personality or opinion or whatnot and start to think for yourself. Quite an educational film in a way. Also great that they can tackle stuff like periods - feel like that wouldn't have happened ten years ago.

Looked beautiful on 70mm. Would like to see it again in a year or something. Hard to know what it's all about quite frankly - I took it to be about having power - from both sides. Freddie has power over Lancaster as he cares so much about him, and Lancaster enjoys having power over his followers and enjoys trying to catch/change Freddie - not sure I see the love story that other people seem to reading online. Good quote about having a master and that."

Some scenes were a bit jarring like when they just cut to the couple mid argument - the argument had no weight to it it was like they'd cut out the beginning to save time. Maybe I would have had him descend into creepiness a bit slower. Robin Williams was pretty good though it was worth watching for him. Don't get many hamsters in movies either. Cool shot of him with his eyes obscured by the car mirror before he leans forward and cool one of him running down the spiral car park.

Less Sci-Fi than I expected and more philosophical/conversational. What does it all mean? I took it to be about faith and human nature but would need to watch again to get a proper grasp. I liked the brown shots at the start they were weird and the shot of the girl which is revealed to be on his shoulders. Why can she suddenly move things with her mind at the end?

Must have been so difficulto play his own abusive father - I wonder if it was cathartic or the opposite. Feel sorry for Shia LaBeouf now.

Great cast. Anya Taylor Joy especially good -you can never imagine anyone else playing the parts she plays. Big and epic, kind of like an icelandic gladiator or something.

But it's amazingly shot, incredibly cool and Robert DeNiro is great. The whole plot and his character are ambiguous and open to interpretation though - it's hard to be totally sympathetic to him because he's so unstable and you never really know what he's thinking or why he's thinking it. Interesting ending too - he ends up a hero when really he was very close to assasinating the senator. In the end though he is basically just the same as he was in the beginning."

The main actress was really good and Sy Ableman is always a perfect dad. I really liked the ending with them all in the van and Danielle and Maya holding hands and maybe realising their lives are kind of separate from their family's. Didn't quite like the score because it reminded me too much of Inside No 9 but I liked the idea of just creating tension like that.

Also it felt more like a film set in that universe rather than a superhero film if that makes sense - it wasn't all about saving the world and whatnot but about the characters in it (plus action scenes). At the end of it all though the story isn't that new or exciting, it's essentially a roadtrip movie that's a tiny bit long. Still good though."

The way it begins with him just not sure of the odd thing before quickly revealing him to have little sense of time or place is amazingly done and frankly very scary.

Interesting to see how the projects in Paris work but it felt a bit too derivative and didn't have much of it's own style. Alexis Manenti made a good shitty cop though.

I like all the saturation and colours and that. Everyone who says it's pretty gay is right. Nowhere near as good as Point Break if we're comparing 80s action.

Worth discussing afterwards - I took it that she was writing two different drafts and that was the two acts, although I didn't come to that conclusion til quite near the end.

Looks beautiful, incredibly reminiscent of a summer holiday, what with the colours, the random friendships with kids around the pool and the sense ofgrowing up you get. At the same time the more the film goes on the more melancholy you get, and when you realise what most likely happens after it is pretty devastating. That being said it didn't really leave me sad, more of a mix of feeling happy that they had this nice holiday but also sad as she is trying to piece together the sides of her dad she didn't really know. More than maybe any other film it really captures that sense of never being able to really know someone. I got very sad when I read this review which I think sums it up perfectly: ""watched this for the… 6th(?) time today. hurts so good. an all-timer. few fiction movies, if any, have better harnessed the inherently haunted power of old home video footage."" Makes you think of all those videos of grandparents etc and wonder what else was happening."

Amazingly good British cast, just about everyone seems to be in it. Tony Wilson seems like a very interesting guy, Steve Coogan is really good although he does seem quite Partridge.

I think it is probably as good an adaptation as there could be for me, but unfortunately I just don't particularly like shakespeare.

No one really gets their comeuppance and they don't really resolve the American character's storyline. Did he lie about qualifying as an architect? Why is he in China at all? Other than that though I liked it, will be intrigued to see if she writes another chinese film rather than some more DC shit.

Incredibly well made and edited, Herzog manages to add to Treadwell's fascinating character at regular intervals. He's a friendly wildlife enthusiast, he's a failed actor, he's a recovering alcoholic, he struggles with his lack of fortune with women, he bloody loves bears, he rages against society, he places himself in his own action film, he puts his girlfriend in danger, and then he becomes increasingly arrogant, believing himself to be the only person that could protect the bears (from what?) but most strangely of all (imo) he films it all himself. But to what end? All that footage with no real feedback? To me it seemed that it was most likely to combat his loneliness, and the bears just happened to be the thing he latched on to. A bit like the guy who becomes obsessed with orchids in Adaptation before swiftly being able to move onto something else. Interesting that he managed to capture this period where the technology existed to pretty easily film all this footage, but before he could get it out into the public very quickly. I'm keen to see more Herzog films I thought he really managed to get every last drop out of this subject, with some weird quirky bits too like how he shot the coroner (who just seemed like an off guy). Also I wonder how Treadwell would have done nowadays, I think he might have found his calling on TikTok. ""If it doesn't scare the cows, who cares?"" I like the Roger Ebert review that says ""I have a certain admiration for his courage, recklessness, idealism, whatever you want to call it, but here is a man who managed to get himself and his girlfriend eaten, and you know what? He deserves Werner Herzog."""

Deadpan funny in parts, touches of surrealism such as the chef cleaning the window, then leaning through it. Didn't quite enjoy it as much as Le Havre but can't put my finger on why. He tells these stories of compassion very well and simply though."

It's a good action film but I'm not sure it goes beyond that really? Especially now that all the technological advances made in The Matrix have been used over and over and probably superseded. Enjoyable still but it's mad how high the rating is on IMDb.

Still has an edge to it and even though I don't like country music the music was good. Jessie Buckley is great again. I reckon she'll have a shout at an oscar in the next few years.

A great, tense shootout at the end. When Clint Eastwood starts drinking you know it's about to go down. Also I liked the way it didn't portray any of them as outright heroes - nor did it make the killing look easy with the focus on the psychological toll their past lives had taken on them.

It's basically about a lady so wrapped up in her work that her dad decides to go to extreme lengths to get her to lighten up. Her dad is an all time great character and it's a clever/rare premise. I think the overall message of the film is that no one should have any problem with having fun and I am on board with that. The hairy suit and naked reception at the end is really great. Probably the longest comedy film I've ever seen and maybe will ever see but it doesn't feel too long (although you could definitely watch it in two sittings)

Not as interesting as other Varda films I've watched perhaps but still beautiful and meandering. Iran looks amazing in 1976. I think it is an outtake from a feature length film."

It's a really great premise in that it kind of focuses more on the horror of becoming a werewolf than the werewolf from a victim's point of view. Brett Goldstein always says how sexy it is which I guess is sort of true although I don't think it would have crossed my mind if he hadn't said it. A bit filmed on Hampstead Heath which was cool.

Really stylish. There was just quite a few bits that I didn't think made sense - the scene where Alison Brie gives her the phone and then basically tells her to fuck off? Strange. When she is suddenly asleep on the road and smashes that guys car? Are we supposed to sympathise with that? Strange. Also kind of out of character as she is really calculating otherwise. The first half or so was brilliantly uncomfortable to watch but I think it loses it's way a bit towards the end, like it had been a bit rushed. All the points it makes are true and smart but it could have been less heavy handed and more effective as a result if you ask me, which seems to be characteristic of a few big films lately (Marvel). Intrigued to see what Emerald Fennell does next."

Great performances all round. There was a Q&A with the director afterwards which was really good. He spoke about trying to get a point-of-hearing (like point of view) of Ruben which worked really well.

Not only is it a fascinating story on paper but the way he gets Dieter to relive it, and watching him remember over and over again without flinching is amazing to watch.

Lhoja is a great, well written, not just your average tough guy turned nice, character and I think films on trains just seem to work. Very funny, very claustrophobic for the first 20 minutes or so, partly down to the setting, partly down to her awkward acting and the stress of the whole situation. There is a great shot, that's slightly longer than it might usually be, of their car driving down a snowy road in peace that made me feel suddenly relieved and I realised that I was quite stressed for the previous 15 minutes or so. Really nice ending with her grinning in the car too, you don't know what might happen next but it captured that giddy feeling really well. Quite want to go on a long train journey in Russia now too.

Not seen Tiffany Haddish in a serious role before and she really came across like she was 'acting' -her tone was all weird for some reason.

Thought it was slightly an odd choice for him to say he was embarassed of his brother at the end - that wasn't the impression given the rest of the time, but maybe he was confessing that so the other guy would feel better about killing him?

Pacing was a bit off I felt - too slow at the beginning, too quick at the end (most of the murders take place in the last half an hour) The ending is really the key part and unfortunately I already knew what happens which did spoil it a bit. Enjoyed the dark colour palette/look of the film. Also it has aged well."

I figure they were trying to emulate an aspirational movie about rising up in an industry but in this situation in a morally reprehensible industry which I get but I just think that wasn't as good as the alternative. Jake Gyllenhall was amazing - so scary and hard to read. Could never quite understand his motives or anything. He was weird and charismatic and it was also interesting that he started as a criminal in the first scene and remained that way throughout. Kind of a success story.

Timothee was great as was the guy who played his dad. Looked beautiful and I didn't mind the slow pace but didn't particularly like Armie Hammer's character.

Jarring at times (which I suppose was the intention) but I just felt it got in the way of the story.Given that this was about a well known figure rather than a well known story I just think it made it harder to understand what did and did not happen. Great performance from Christian Bale and Sam Rockwell though.

Never seen a Ken Loach film before I don't think so it was very interesting. Some parts I didn't understand because of the Irish accent or lines being muttered but overall it was very interesting and a good story that English people should know more about. Also thought it was interesting that they seemed to leave in lots of lines where the actor had stumbled slightly which I suppose added realism.

Feels very much like a film about the director's friends (which I'm sure it was) so it kind of felt like you had to be there.

Not as good as the first one I don't think. Not really any animated films that are quite in the same vein at the moment - i.e. purely a comedy. Weird to see how the animation is starting to look dated.

Tim Key was very funny as he always is but felt like everything else was trying a bit hard. Felt like a list of funny things that could happen at a wedding jammed into a story.

Surprised I hadn't heard of it before. You can tell it was made with real love for food  which I liked, and Stanley Tucci and his pal were really great. Good twist when it turns out Secondo isn't perfect. Lot's of really clever shots of the meal too - the spinning shot in the restaurant, the shot of the table when everyone is full and the one of the guy singing into the camera. Also the final shot of the omelette cooking is great."

If I had I think it would have reached cult status like Mean Girls. Not quite as funny but pretty close. Plenty of plot holes but none of them matter. Enjoyed it more than I expected (and I did expect to enjoy it). Best part was when the witness' boyfriend stormed out of the courtroom.

Well acted and great script but I thought a few times it was building to a satisfying crescendo only for it it to stop. Great shot of the whiskey and pepto and also Ed Balq is a villain despite only being in one scene.

Really liked the rhythm of the first 70 mins with long, slow chase scenes that are kept interesting by the score followed by action/dialogue. Didn't really understand the third act when he was trying to get her to dress like madeleine - did he really not realise it was her? Why was he so forceful about it? Were we supposed to sympathise with him because he was in mourning? I think it was hard to as you didn't really see them fall in love - he just followed her and they talked a couple of times and then bang they were in love."

Very good at getting across how complicated these things are. Sal the store owner clearly isn't racist, but you can understand his customer's anger to an extent - it's the way they direct it which is important. Sal obviously didn't intend for Radio Raheem to be killed but if he had just given in to Buggin Out then he would have lived. The violence at the end relieves some pressure but then the next day what has changed? Nothing - as implied by the radio presenter who says it will be even hotter today.

Possibly better on second viewing. Great tailoring, acting was good but too difficult to understand without being able to pause and make notes. Also I'm sure there were several plotholes and the motive for the bad guy really didn't add up (as they often don't). Also tricky to hear what people were saying."

Worked incredibly well am surprised it isn't used in more films. Like the ultimate version of an unreliable narrator. Better than Tenet. Tenet is just what happens if you throw money at a clever story like this. They are similar in many ways but in Tenet all the add-ons detract from the movie where Memento keeps it simple (or simple enough). That being said I think there should have been a stronger motive for him to kill Teddy - maybe him making it clearer that he has been using him to kill whoever."

On a separate note I question whether heroism towards a supreme court judge is really healthy for society as a whole. Even when basically deserved I think it reflects badly on the partisan nature of the times.

Quite scary in places, walking back in the rain was unnerving given all the murders take place in the rain. All round fantastic film. "

Gina Rodriguez was really good, the film really got going when she turned up. Evan Wood was transformed from Westworld - I reckon her voice was a bit too ridiculous, too deep to be funny anymore. Enjoyably different. Really liked the surreal touches like the death scene and the bubbles leaking down the wall. Was just the right amount of weird without being over the top."

Surprising that it is so surprising but it is rare outside of high school movies like Superbad to see such a positive spin. Handled all the issues well with Tommy's death and Peter's drama with his wife. Mads is really really great, subtle across a broad spectrum of intoxication and confidence ending in a classic dance scene at the end. The rest of the main cast, also great. Funny and feel-good but also maybe makes a great point? Will start day drinking on Monday."

It was entertaining for sure just not quite as much as I anticipated. Also the real life plan was marginally more complicated and interesting so not sure why they didn't tell that.

The band starts off playing cool music but ends up sounding a bit too much like Mcfly for their popularity to be believed. The film ends up focusing too much on the girl and not enough on the characters in the band who are more interesting/fun if you ask me.

Extremely cool. Felt almost like an incredibly accurate period piece of the 90s being shot by the cast. The main kid was really good and considering most of the cast are skateboarders they were almost all very good. Really good soundtrack too.

Seth Rogen's character surprisingly works really well and they kind of do seem right for one another despite their differences which is kind of why it works. Charlize Theron seems like maybe she should be president? Notably funny sex scene also. A future cult classic perhaps.

A couple of moments where they tried to make it funny maybe but not enough. Pretty sure it's full of plot holes/unexplained plot but cba trying to think about it too much. Completely forgettable.

Why was a child literally the only thing that could fix that part of the train? What was the deal with the club carriage? Why was Chris Evans cast? Aside from that Tilda Swinton was great and the general premise was kind of interesting. Most of the action scenes were good and the whole set design was cool, packing every shot into a narrow train carriage etc. Ultimately pretty disappointing but not awful."

Some of the music was really great but there were several occasions where the choice of music was bizarre such as the gary glitter bit and the bit where the Wall Street guys were singing to him on the train (that especially made no sense, why would they be singing? Dumb). Also it was too explicit when talking about his emotions i.e. him just saying I have bad thoughts or saying society has left him behind etc etc rather than showing it. The ending was good (if troubling) although can't help but think Robert De Niro wasn't really trying - some of his questions to the Joker when he was on the talk show having just confessed to a triple murder just seemed ridiculous. ""oh how did you feel about killing them lol?"". Film did look really nice. Also didn't help that the person behind me at the cinema was talking after nearly every single piece of dialogue."

Tom Hanks character perhaps borders on creepy? Certainly a fine line with the way he manipulates her. Could have done with alonger ending where she explains how she feels/has a go at him for lying.

Enjoyed most of it but let down by the ending. Feel like it could have made a 9/10 if it had just managed to be a little bit darker/bloodier like it kept hinting.

I guess it's about death and worrying about death and how odd the human mind is and how futile/pointless lots of information is. Nice dread filled film to start off the year. Adam Driver is great as always. Maybe Greta Gerwig is a bit underused? Random dance scene in the end credits is good. Weirdly high budget I thought.

There were bubbles, the seat shook around loads, there was smoke and splashing and rain. All very intense for a 3 hour movie - probably wouldn't go through that again although it was fun. The movie itself was pretty good, some great action scenes and underwater stuff that looked amazing. The rain and smoke for clouds were probably most effective - also the boat scenes where it felt like we were bobbing up and down in our seats. Ended kind of in the exact same way as the first one though I think. Also Spyder is a shitty character and not a great actor."

Shares some themes with Aftersun - realising that your parents are flawed and how to navigate that. Doesn’t really have the same emotional impact or warmth though. Carey Mulligan is pretty great although I think her character changes too quickly.

Definitely some JK Simmons in Whiplash vibes. Really kept me interested throughout, not quite on the edge of my seat but it rolls along at a good pace. Kind of put off by the ending - I get it but it just felt slightly too comical in a jarring way. Overall it was very good though and didn't feel long at all."

In particular the scene with his mum tapping on the piano with her big nails, that felt like it must be a really vivid memory. Basically Steven Spielberg shooting his own biopic which is pretty cool. Paul Dano and Michelle Williams both great - mad that Paul Dano hasn't won an oscar at any point he's good in absolutely everything. Really good bit breaking the 4th wall towards the end."

Moonie is great, especially that second to last scene where it all gets too much for her and she breaks down to her friend, that felt so real and was extra emotional given how tough and unaffected she had been up until that point. I thought the stylistic clash at the end didn't really work - might have been better on a better quality TV? On mine it just looked like we were suddenly watching a bad YouTube video. Willem Dafoe is great and extremely likable for once."

The Lost City is the only recent example I can think of but that was a fair bit smaller. Pretty fun and Brendan Fraser is good & dashing. A bit long though.

Really takes the whole suburbia thing to the next level. The side plot with Beck Bennett being obsessed with pool water is a super duper good bit. The way he is constantly walking around with a huge water bottle is very funny. Also the bit with Julian calling his mum a school. Took a while to get into it but after that basically every line was funny in some way. Cool music, v good & strange."

Very similar In lots of ways to The Worst Person in the World, similar shots, similar scenes in some cases but the themes are different. Really well written, it's essentially a bunch of different conversations that Anders is having with people as he tries to connect to someone but (a bit like aftersun) there are just little bits you are left to pick up on to understand his inner thoughts. Kept hoping that he was going to connect with something and find a reason to live but perhaps the ending is more realistic than that."

Lots of crazy camerawork - especially when riding in the ambulance - fast motion, sideways shots, shots from the front that were a bit like the shots at the end of Prisoners. Nicolas Cage was great and a little more restrained than usual - I'd like to see what other big directors would do with him like maybe PTA. Especially liked the shot of Ving Rhames looking up at the camera when getting the punks to hold hands and try and revive the singer. Cool soundtrack and use of sound too. Weird that it isn't as well liked as other Scorsese films - maybe paramedics don't seem interesting enough or something?"

Makes you realise there might be tens of thousands of stories like this out there (but that doesn't make it any less interesting). At first I thought he might have revealed too much of the story too soon but it keeps going, with other layers being peeled back (mental health/hoarding/France etc) as it goes. Amazing pictures too, I particularly love the self portraits in the shiny things and the wonky mirror being carried into a skip. Makes you want to take one million photos."

Crime epic in a similar vein to Casino. The de-aging was interesting - didn't really find it off-putting though it was noticeable, potentially just because everyone knows what he looked like at that age anyway. DeNiro was obviously amazing, but not as good as Al Pacino. It was actually a pretty sad story - he works all his life for other bosses, then kills one of his only friends, and by the end, everyone else has died and he's alone with nothing to show for it."

The cinematography was really interesting with loads and loads of fisheye shots and wide angle stuff. Not sure what the reasoning was but I liked it.

Overall I didn't really get into the main character which is what maybe let it down. I think it needed a stronger central performance maybe.

Also similar to The Fablemans in the way it felt like it was full of little specific memories - the knitting unravelling as his mum runs to the door, the random things happening in the cinema (at one point a guy gets shot I think?), etc. Didn't make me cry like it did Emma but maybe on a rewatch."

Also one of the few films that makes me wish I smoked, especially walking around the supermarket striking matches on whatever and picking up catfood with a fag hanging out my mouth. How cool.

Jason Schwarzmann plays a tougher guy than usual and it's his best role in a Wes Anderson film, all the bits between him and Scarlett Johansson are the best bits. Lots of witty lines and funny kids, the alien is great, the set is unbelievably nice and there is a fair amount of stuff happening, as well as all the style.

I don’t think the story of missed loves quite resonated with me as it might have if my life was in a different place but it was still very much worth watching. Plus I liked the soundtrack (often very western?) and the allusions to Chungking Express.

At first it seems like a pretty standard Mexico cartel film but really there is a lot more to it and it’s a bit more of a commentary on America's war on drugs I suppose. I think the only thing letting it down was the reason for Emily Blunt's character being there seemed a bit convenient/unexplained. She was very good though and del Toro was amazing. Still not sure it carried quite enough tension as say Prisoners but it was a good watch. Also a nice score and looked great throughout.

Really liked it, felt like a great summary of adolescence, particularly with all the little tangents and unexplained side stories (the Penguin, the headmaster playing piano, the pervy teachers). Combined with the final vaguely dreamy sequence in the evening where he has 3 dates it very much resembles what it feels like to look back on teenagehood.It's noticably an extremely friendly film - there is no meanness or enemy at any point, which I think was nice as that's mostly how I remember school. Also had maybe the best haircuts."

I enjoyed the low key energy of the weird gang and the sudden killings of quite a few seemingly important characters (most shocking being the ice cream girl). The score is really really good, a very catchy precursor to the Goldeneye N64 soundtrack and considering this was basically a student film it's pretty amazing. I like the way the gang members are always just running about in a horde, that was a weird and cool choice."

It's always scary to think how recently these things went on, it was only like 15 years before the first iPod.

Adam Driver is great though of course.

Also though it had loads of cool dolly zooms, a crazy good cast and a great score so I'm surprised people didn't like it at the time. The story was a little bit dull/repetitive but I think the cool outweighs that."

Hard to put my finger on what that is but I felt like everyone could relate to it. May be torturous to watch if you were in a place where you felt you had missed a chance like that (though it would still be fucking great) but thankfully I am not."

Really well designed setting with most of the goings on in an Inn in the middle of a valley in a Chinese desert. Loved that bit when he fires the arrow out of the flask back through the window - real noice. Didn't enjoy it so much when they left the Inn (other than the final battle), perhaps one battle too many. A must watch if you're into this kinda thing."

Maybe the pacing was just too slow for me but I don't really see how it is a love letter to cinema or anything like that. If anything it was like a ""goodbye, cinema is over, oh well"" sort of vibe. I think I tried hard enough but none of it really resonated with me and it was hard to be invested in any of it. I liked 3 things - it kind of captured the communal loneliness of the cinema, the old dudes from Dragon Inn watching themselves and discussing the fact no one remembers them any more (great and sad), and the urinal scene that takes forever but was pretty funny."

I can't put my finger on why it is but he manages to make you feel like you are every single character. I am a kid wanting to take pictures of the mosquitos to show his mum, I am a teenage girl jealous of her grown up neighbour, I am a Taiwanese business man in a meeting with a fascinating Japanese dude trying not to sell out, I am a lady worried she's not done enough with her life, I am a kid that brought in a balloon to school and got told off because they thought it was a condom, etc etc etc. Man it's good."

Some of the story didn't quite justify itself, like the speech that she makes about fighting in juvie just wasn't that impressive and I found everyone's reaction weird. That being said the fight scene at the end was great and more comedy films should lean into that kind of nonsense."
